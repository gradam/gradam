__*The code is just a tool, but still, you have to know how to use it.*__

I help people (and sometimes myself) make ideas come true. I've been doing it for over half a decade now! Technologies such as Python, React or AWS were very helpful along the way.

I am passionate about entrepreneurship, startups, new technologies and sharing knowledge. I am a mentor for several aspiring programmers and ex-mentor for some that have become mentors themselves.
